React Native brings [**React**'s][r] declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.

- **Declarative.** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based.** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Developer Velocity.** See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
- **Portability.** Reuse code across iOS, Android, and [other platforms][p].

React Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors. Find out more in our [ecosystem overview][e].




## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 10.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. you may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.
